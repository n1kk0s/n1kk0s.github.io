                            While researching different applications for video games and VR, I was reminded that two of my game design professors work in educational gaming. 
                            Seeing as this is a combination of my greatest interest and something I value highly, I decided to take a deeper look into applying video games to education.
                            <br><br>
                            <a href="http://sheu.org.uk/sites/sheu.org.uk/files/imagepicker/1/eh203mg.pdf">This</a> 
                            paper written by Mark Griffiths, a psychology professor, on how video games may be used to help facilitate education. 
                            He mentions how they hone certain skills and provide an opportunity to capture the attention of people, specifically younger people. 
                            He also states that video games can be used to compare metrics from different people against a baseline or against each other to measure certain skills.
                            <br><br>
                            To me, games have always been not only a way to consume entertainment, but also a way to improve critical skills like spatial skills and critical thinking skills. 
                            The games that I primarily play involve making decisions that affect the game plot, forcing the player to think about consequences before making decisions. 
                            I don’t think it’s hard to jump to the conclusion that video games could be designed to enhance other skills as well.
                            <br><br>
                            I’ve heard that this approach, gamification of learning, is taking place even here at Penn State. 
                            Some professors have mentioned that some instructors associate assignments to quests, points to experience points, exams to boss battles, and overall course grades to levels. 
                            Students in these classes aren’t trying to get a 95 on their homework assignment to get an A in the course, they’re trying to gain more experience points to reach level 15 in 
                            their English skill, for instance. Even this slight change in the naming of things can garner more interest from students, specifically ones who are traditionally into games.
                            <br><br>
                            In addition to just a simple renaming of course items, some education could be embedded directly into video games. This is what I would like to see more of. 
                            Video games are designed to keep the player’s interest, and striking a good balance between immersion and education can provide a player with a very desirable 
                            way to learn new material. I think this would be the best option in environments such as elementary, middle, and high school. Keeping the attention of some students 
                            is downright impossible in these settings, and video games could help that. One of the best-behaved classes I had in high school was a shop class where we used 
                            a video game to study bridge building physics. Video games are designed to keep people entertained, and I think there’s a lot we can do with them to improve education.
