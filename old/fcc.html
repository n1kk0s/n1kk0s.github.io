                            	<br><br>
                                Recently, Congress repealed regulations that Obama had passed back in 2016 while still in office. 
                                These regulations were put in place to safeguard the privacy of consumers from their Internet Service Provider(ISP) such as Comcast or Verizon. 
                                They prevented your ISP from silently collecting your data and selling it. 
                                In order for them to collect and sell your data, your consent was needed. 
                                Now, that is no longer true.
                                <br><br>
	                            This repeal seems pretty detrimental to any privacy oriented consumers, and I think it is. 
                                One TechCrunch <a href=https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/28/house-vote-sj-34-isp-regulations-fcc/>article</a> had the following to say:
                                <br><br>
                                “Under the regulation rollback, there are few limits on the ways ISPs will be allowed to interact with sensitive user data. 
                                That includes not just allowing providers to create marketing profiles based on the browsing history of their users, but also letting them deploy undetectable tools that track web traffic, too.”
                                <br><br>
                                In all technology focused fields, security is heavily stressed. 
                                In fact, I would argue that security is heavily stressed in every field. 
                                Government, retail, and even things like food service. 
                                Every field uses technology which relies on security. 
                                <br><br>
                                Consumers guard their privacy vehemently. 
                                Debates over Windows 10’s Cortana, Amazon’s Alexa, and Google Assistant take place daily on the internet. 
                                These services are heavily dislike by some consumers simply because they require personal data to be offered up in order to work.
                                <br><br>
                                It’s not only the consumers that want to protect their privacy, but the government has made action to protect consumer privacy before. 
                                Recall the case between Apple Inc. and the FBI. 
                                The FBI was demanding that Apple create a security vulnerability in the operating systems of all iPhones in order to access the data on an iPhone recovered from a terrorist. 
                                In the end, Apple refused to create the backdoor on the grounds that all iPhone owners would be vulnerable to cyber-attacks, and have their sensitive data stolen.
                                <br><br>
                                I think this was not a smart move. 
                                Security is favored by a vast majority of people, and it’s an absolute requirement if we’re going to keep moving forward with our technology and the internet. 
                                I think the main concern will be who your ISP will sell your data to. 
                                It could be a company paying out loads of money in order to find ways to manipulate users either by phishing attempts, social engineering, or whatever means necessary. 
                                <br><br>
                                It’s also concerning that any ISP can do this, and if you want the internet, you are going to use the ISP that is available to you. 
                                This lack of consumer choice almost guarantees that your data will be sold to other companies. 
                                Seeing how consumers can’t avoid an ISP, they must take extra steps to protect their data, and I don’t think it’s acceptable.
                                <br><br>

                                <br><br>
                                <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/no-republicans-didnt-just-strip-away-your-internet-privacy-rights/2017/04/04/

                                viewpoint from mine. The main takeaway I got from this is they feel the government stepped in and limited one type of internet company, and 
                                not all, stating that operating systems and internet-based companies like Google can still gather and sell your data. I still hold the 
                                stance that an ISP is largely different from Microsoft Windows or Google. There are tons of reliable operating systems like macOS, Ubuntu, 
                                LinuxMint, Arch, etc. and there are plenty of search engines like DuckDuckGo, Bing, and Yahoo. Again, if you want high-quality reliable internet 
                                service, you have very limited options when it comes to big name ISPs. Those big names can change their privacy policies any time in order to collect 
                                data unless you opt out. Not a good thing, in my opinion.
