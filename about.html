                                            My name is Nick Weld and I was born in Clearfield County on March 6, 1996. 
                                            Until I was 20, I lived in the small town (if you could call it that) of Sanborn, Pennsylvania, roughly 10 minutes from Houtzdale.  
                                            Living in such a remote area, there wasn't much to do; no neighbors to play with and no internet to browse. 
                                            Due to this lack of recreational activitites, I played a lot of video games in my spare time. 
                                            Those very games are what started to get me interested in technology.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Most of my life, until about half-way through high school, I lacked access to the internet at my house. 
                                            Once it finally made it's way to my neck of the woods, I became near obsessed with the web and the technology that made it work. 
                                            There was such a vast wealth of knowledge on the internet, and exploring the different things you could do with and on it became one of the driving forces behind the passion I've developed for technology.
                                        </p>

                                        <img src="images/school.jpg" style="width:100%;"/>

                                    <div class="mdl-card__supporting-text">
                                        <p>
                                         I went to school at Moshannon Valley Jr./Sr. High School, located near Houtzdale, Pennsylvania. 
                                         While some of the courses lacked a challenge, it equipped me with the basic knowledge I needed to persue what I wanted to. 
                                         I was able to take courses on animation, Photoshop, web design, and more in-depth sciences. 
                                         These classes may have been few and far between, but they still gave me enough information to satisfy my appetite for technical knowledge.
                                         <br><br>
                                         I wasn't involved in too many extra-curricular activities throughout high school, but I cared about the ones that I was a part of. 
                                         The two most important clubs I was active in were the yearbook, and our school's anti-bullying club. <br>
                                         Yearbook allowed me to get to know my way around a camera and many different Adobe software products such as InDesign, Photoshop, Illustrator, and even AfterEffects. 
                                         Since our yearbook staff consisted of roughly six to eight kids, everyone was required to have a pretty good understanding of each of these. <br>
                                         As an advocate against bullying in our high school, I helped with the creation of our anti-bullying club, and led a school wide activity known as "Cross the Line". 
                                         This activity was a series of progressively more personal "if this happened to you, cross the line" styled questions. 
                                         It was the single most unifying experience in the school's history, and I was grateful to have experienced it.

                                         For college, I decided to attend the Pennsylvania State University for Information Sciences and Technology. 
                                         I spent my first two years studying at Penn State Altoona where I met some of the most influential instructors I've known, and they helped me a great deal. 
                                         The smaller scale of the Altoona campus was a great experience for me, and it provided the opportunity to more strongly understand not only my field, but many of my other interests, too. 
                                         <br><br>
                                        For the Fall 2016 semester, I transferred to Penn State's University Park campus. 
                                        IST wasn't an offered degree at the Altoona campus, so I came here to finish my degree and hopefully learn more and push myself harder. 
                                        So far, it has been a great experience getting to study a vast number of topics within my field and exploring topics outside of IST as well.

                                         You can probably tell that I'm interested in technology from what you've read so far, but I have plenty of other interests in addition to fidgeting around with new (and old) technology. 
                                         Some of those things include playing video games, taking and editing photos, programming and web-design, drawing and painting, and taking care of my two guinea pigs. 

                                        As you can see, these are a few of the other things I like to do in my spare time. 
                                        I've always felt constrained by the 24 hours in a day: It doesn't provide enough time to learn all of the skills I would like to learn.
