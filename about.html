                                            My name is Nick Weld and I was born in Clearfield County on March 6, 1996. 
                                            Until I was 20, I lived in the small town (if you could call it that) of Sanborn, Pennsylvania, roughly 10 minutes from Houtzdale.  
                                            Living in such a remote area, there wasn't much to do; no neighbors to play with and no internet to browse. 
                                            Due to this lack of recreational activitites, I played a lot of video games in my spare time. 
                                            Those very games are what started to get me interested in technology.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Most of my life, until about half-way through high school, I lacked access to the internet at my house. 
                                            Once it finally made it's way to my neck of the woods, I became near obsessed with the web and the technology that made it work. 
                                            There was such a vast wealth of knowledge on the internet, and exploring the different things you could do with and on it became one of the driving forces behind the passion I've developed for technology.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                         I went to school at Moshannon Valley Jr./Sr. High School, located near Houtzdale, Pennsylvania. 
                                         While some of the courses lacked a challenge, it equipped me with the basic knowledge I needed to persue what I wanted to. 
                                         I was able to take courses on animation, Photoshop, web design, and more in-depth sciences. 
                                         These classes may have been few and far between, but they still gave me enough information to satisfy my appetite for technical knowledge.
                                         <br><br>
                                         I wasn't involved in too many extra-curricular activities throughout high school, but I cared about the ones that I was a part of. 
                                         The two most important clubs I was active in were the yearbook, and our school's anti-bullying club. <br>
                                         Yearbook allowed me to get to know my way around a camera and many different Adobe software products such as InDesign, Photoshop, Illustrator, and even AfterEffects. 
                                         Since our yearbook staff consisted of roughly six to eight kids, everyone was required to have a pretty good understanding of each of these. <br>
                                         As an advocate against bullying in our high school, I helped with the creation of our anti-bullying club, and led a school wide activity known as "Cross the Line". 
                                         This activity was a series of progressively more personal "if this happened to you, cross the line" styled questions. 
                                         It was the single most unifying experience in the school's history, and I was grateful to have experienced it.

                                         For college, I decided to attend the Pennsylvania State University for Information Sciences and Technology. 
                                         I spent my first two years studying at Penn State Altoona where I met some of the most influential instructors I've known, and they helped me a great deal. 
                                         The smaller scale of the Altoona campus was a great experience for me, and it provided the opportunity to more strongly understand not only my field, but many of my other interests, too. 
                                         <br><br>
                                        For the Fall 2016 semester, I transferred to Penn State's University Park campus. 
                                        IST wasn't an offered degree at the Altoona campus, so I came here to finish my degree and hopefully learn more and push myself harder. 
                                        So far, it has been a great experience getting to study a vast number of topics within my field and exploring topics outside of IST as well.

                                            <h6><strong>Port Sky Cafe</strong></h6>
                                            My first job was actually when I first came to college. 
                                            I worked at Penn State Altoona's Port Sky Cafe serving other students. 
                                            Since it was my first job, I learned a lot about working together with people that I hadn't been able to learn in high school. 
                                            After working there for two years, I had to move on to something better here in State College, 
                                             but the skills I gained from Port have and will continue to help me throughout my career.

                                            <h6><strong>PSU Applied Research Laboratory</strong></h6>
                                            Over the summer, after I left Altoona campus, I decided that I had learned enough to jump into an IT position, so I applied for a student position at 
                                             Penn State's Applied Research Lab. While it was a frightening and overwhelming experience at first, I've come to know and respect the role I have there. 
                                            As of now, I've primarily worked to support other staff members with their technology problems. 
                                            However, I have still had the opportunities to gain more experience working with computer hardware, business specific policies and processes, and other team members as efficiently as possible.

                                         While I absolutely love doing things field specific, such as programming, I still need some things that help me relax occasionally. 
                                         <br><br>
                                         My definite favorite passtime is playing video games. 
                                         To some, it's a "childish" or "immature" passtime, but for me, it is a way for me to make large impacts on worlds and be faced with decisions that push my critical thinking skills. 
                                         Video games allow me to not only observe a story, but actively shape it, which I find fascinating.
                                         <br><br>
                                         I also love spending time with all of the pets in my life! 
                                         I have two guinea pigs (Flynn and Felix), two dogs (Cooper and Koda), four cats (Bandit, Cassie, Bella, and Ozzy), and I usually see another dog (Willow) each weekend! 
                                         Of course, all of these animals aren't at my apartment with me, I only have Cooper, Flynn, and Felix here with me, but I see all the other pets at least once a week.
                                         <br><br>
                                         There are a ton of other things that I like doing in my spare time as well, probably too many to list. 
                                         I like everything from exploring outdoors to building computers to
